# servletWebsite

I built a Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP) website. It provides instruction in building web pages dynamically, organizing projects into web applications, and deploying these applications using a web server, such as Apache Tomcat. Servlets as middleware in an N-tiered design structure (acting as a middle layer between requests coming from Web browsers or other HTTP clients and databases or applications on the HTTP server).
The conceptual frameworks of the Servlet life cycle, handling client requests, generating server responses, handling cookies, session tracking, the proper uses of JSPs, and the integration of Servlets and JSPs using the MVC (model view controller) architecture are all discussed.
